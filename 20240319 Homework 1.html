<p>I have visualized Deng Xiaoping’s 1992 Southern Tour (南巡) as well as his diplomatic visit to the United States in 1979, with Geo plot in <a href='https://pyecharts.org/#/zh-cn/'>Pyecharts</a>.</p>
<p>Divided into two tabs, it visualizes these visits of crucial importance to the modern history of China.</p>

<p>My field of research and interest is history and archaeology of the classical antiquity.</p>
<p>I have tried to visualize the data acquired from <em>Catalogo del Museo Nazionale Archeologico di Taranto: II, 2. Rutigliano I. La Necropoli di Contrada Purgatorio. Scavo 1978</em> (2006), which documents the early excavation work in Rutigliano, Apulia, a site of particular interest to me.</p>
<p>The data have been keyed in manually by me (in total, 1970 objects; 94 tombs).</p>
<p>From 525 BC to 325 BC, every 25 years, I calculate how many samples have been discovered for each type of objects. The results are shown both in the bar chart and in the pie chart.</p>

<p><em>Res Gestae Divi Augusti</em> is a very interesting text documenting the deeds of Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus, also known as Octavian. It has been studied meticulously by generations of scholars previously and many have focused on the careful wording of it.</p>
<p>I make use of <a href='http://cltk.org/'>The Classical Language Toolkit</a> to retrieve lemma and part-of-speech from the conjugated/declined original Latin text, and then generate WordCloud according to the Term Frequency of the lemmata. I have made an overall result, and two additional plots for noun and verb respectively.</p>
<p>Augustus seems indeed to favor such terms as <em>populus Romanus</em> (Roman people), <em>senatus</em> (senate). And <em>meus</em>, -<em>a</em>, -<em>um</em> (my) is mentioned frequently, strengthening the presence of Octavian himself.</p>
<p>We owe credit to Richard S. Forsyth, David I. Holmes and Emily K. Tse, <a href='https://academic.oup.com/dsh/article-abstract/14/3/375/936871'>“Cicero, Sigonio, and Burrows: Investigating the Authenticity of the <em>Consolatio</em>”</a> (1999), a pioneering work accentuating the value of term frequency statistics to the study of the Latin language.</p>
